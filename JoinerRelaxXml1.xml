    <introductions>My Dear Friend</introductions>

<paragraph>I recieved your kind letter yesterday if silence is expressive of ones deep feeling then in this
way I must ask you to recieve the emotions of what my heart *and pen* cannot express hoping
the time is not far distant when we may see each other but I must tell you what I am trying to
accomplish having seen the notice in the paper of Mrs Stowe intention to visit England I felt
there would not be much hope of coming before her for some time and I thought if I could get
her to take <person female="1">Louisa</person> with her she might get interested enough if she could do nothing herself she
    might help Louisa to do something besides I thought <person female="1"> Louisa</person> would be a very good
representative of a Southern Slave she has improved much in her studies and I think that she
has energy enough to do something for the cause she only needs to to be put in the field I told
my Ideas to Mrs Willis she thought they were good and offered to write Mrs Stowe she wrote
last Tuesday asking her protection and if she would place her in some Antislavery family
unless her services could be useful to her which I would perfer myself intending to pay her
expenses there the letter was directed as yours when it is answered you shall know dear Amy
since I haveno fear of my name coming before those whom I have lived in dread of I can not
be happy without trying to be useful in some way I had a kind note from dear Sarah saying that
she would be in <place>New york</place> on the <date day="0001-01-20"> 20*th*</date> and wished to know our street and number I am going
    down to see her and<person female="2"> Mrs Bush</person> and if Mrs B do not sail on the <date day="0001-01-20"> 20*th*</date> will you drop me a line to
    let me know I send an answer to<person female="3">Sarah</person> to day also as she will not be there unless Mrs B sails I
shall be more than glad to see you all</paragraph>
