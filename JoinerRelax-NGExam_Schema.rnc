# Instructions: 
# To begin, save this schema file with YOUR NAME in the filename.
# Correct the schema to make it valid Relax NG code. 
# Then associate the schema with the XML file to continue correcting it to validate the XML. 
# There are 9 critical errors in this Relax-NG schema that will make oXygen RED with anger. 
# Your goal is to make it well-formed and to correct it so that it validates the XML (happy green oXygen for both documents). 
# **NOTE**: DO NOT change the XML file, except for adding the schema line! 
# There are four opportunities to improve the schema to make it a more precise and robust validation tool,
# but these will not cause a formedness or validation error (oXygen will be green even with these errors).
# The rules with these errors are followed by a hashtag (#).
# We require you to solve at least two of these errors for the 10 points this exam is worth.
# The other two, if found, will be worth 1/2 of a bonus point each.
# Tips: Press control/command plus on the schema so that you can see the format of the rules more clearly, 
# and use the outline view on the XML document to see where tags sit in the document's hierarchy.
# When you are finished, upload BOTH the schema and the XML file to Courseweb using the upload point for this exam.
