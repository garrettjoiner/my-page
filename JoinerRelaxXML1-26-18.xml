    <introductions>Esteemed Friend,</introductions>
    <paragraph>... I hope you will call  see, if she is now in the city, one of the most interesting cases of
    escape from slavery that you have ever seen. She was sent from this city yesterday morning
    consigned to <person>Mr. Johnston.</person> She is from<place> N.C.</place>was brought away by a sea captain. She was
    sold by her master to the speculators  to avoid being sent away she was hidden for <date>7 years</date>!
    in a small upper room of a house occupied by colored people  within a hundred yards of her
    <person>master's</person> <place>house</place>, who did not know she was there. She had not seen her boy, for 7 years till
    within 3 days of her coming away. She has been shut up so long that she can hardly walk.
    Another woman was brought away from <place>Delaware</place>, who was found tied to a tree. If <person>Mr.
        Johnston</person> was the man he ought to be, he would invite you occasionally to see some of these
        remarkable cases, which are continually passing from <place>Phil.</place> to <place>N.Y.</place> <person>The Vagrant</person> what a queer
    mistake. The Vigilance Committee of this city are doing a fine business in weakening 
    delapidating the edifice of slavery. Success to them...
